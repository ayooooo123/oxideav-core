/// the tail of `planes`: [`VideoPlane`] values whose shape is impossible
/// for an image plane, which makes them unambiguous. Every record has
/// non-empty `data` and a `stride` that no image plane can have —
/// either `0` (an image plane's `data` is `stride × rows` long, so a
/// zero stride forces empty data) or a value above `isize::MAX`
/// (`stride × rows` with any non-zero row count would exceed what a
/// `Vec` can hold). The whole `stride > isize::MAX` band is reserved
/// for side-channel tags. Five record kinds exist, distinguished by
/// their `stride` tag:
///
/// - **Palette** — `stride == 0`. Carries the color table for
///   palette-indexed content
///   ([`PixelFormat::Pal8`](crate::PixelFormat::Pal8)); see
///   [`palette`](Self::palette) / [`set_palette`](Self::set_palette).
/// - **Per-plane significant bits** — `stride == usize::MAX`. Carries
///   mixed per-plane bit depths (e.g. 12-bit luma with 10-bit chroma
///   from a wavelet codec's custom signal range); see
///   [`significant_bits`](Self::significant_bits) /
///   [`set_significant_bits`](Self::set_significant_bits).
/// - **Colour signal** — `stride == usize::MAX - 1`. Carries a
///   [`ColorSignal`] (sample range + H.273 primaries / transfer /
///   matrix) for producers whose signal is per-picture or that have no
///   stream object to put it on; see
///   [`color_signal`](Self::color_signal) /
///   [`set_color_signal`](Self::set_color_signal).
/// - **Layer identity** — `stride == usize::MAX - 2`. Carries a
///   [`LayerIdentity`] (layer / view / access-unit) for frames of
///   multi-layer or multi-view streams; see [`layer`](Self::layer) /
///   [`set_layer`](Self::set_layer).
/// - **Display duration** — `stride == usize::MAX - 3`. Carries how
///   long the picture stays on screen from its `pts`, for producers
///   that know it when they emit the frame (bitmap subtitles with an
///   end time); see [`display_duration`](Self::display_duration) /
///   [`set_display_duration`](Self::set_display_duration).
///
/// The records compose: a frame can carry any subset at once, in any
/// order, within the trailing run of side-channel-shaped entries. The
/// typed accessors find each record by its `stride` tag regardless of
/// order, and [`image_planes`](Self::image_planes) /
/// [`image_plane_count`](Self::image_plane_count) exclude the whole
/// trailing run. Frames without any attached side-channel are
/// byte-for-byte identical to what they always were.
///
/// Consumers that index `planes` directly (rather than through
/// [`image_planes`](Self::image_planes)) see the records as extra
/// trailing entries; producers attaching a record to every frame of a
/// stream should therefore prefer the stream-level home
/// ([`CodecParameters`](crate::CodecParameters)) for data that does not
/// vary per picture, and attach per-frame records when the value is
/// genuinely per-picture or no stream object exists.
