//! Container traits (demuxer + muxer) and a registry.
//!
//! This module defines the abstract [`Demuxer`] / [`Muxer`] traits that
//! every container implementation (oxideav-mp4, oxideav-mkv,
//! oxideav-flac, oxideav-ogg, …) fulfils, plus a
//! [`ContainerRegistry`] that consumers of the framework use to pick a
//! demuxer by probe bytes or filename hint.
